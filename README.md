 A discord bot for ark management.
</p>

I coded this bot to make it easier for ark players to trade and manage their discord servers, its been a while and i dont have much time anymore to continue, so i decided to make it open source, feel free to modify and let me know of any issue.

- Get a discord bot token in discord portal and rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` in ADMB folder, and also replace the token with your bot token.


## Credits:
- None, let me know if i forgot to add someone.
